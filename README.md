## SimpleCalendar
SimpleCalendar is an easy-to-use iOS (iPhone) calendar that allows you to manage your calendar using the SimpleCalendar controller. This calendar gives you complete control over various elements such as color, title, start date, end date, and more. You can implement the SimpleCalendarDelegate protocol to receive selected dates or provide dates as a data source.
