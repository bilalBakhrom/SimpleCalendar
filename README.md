## SimpleCalendar
SimpleCalendar is an easy-to-use calendar for iOS (iPhone) that allows you to manage your calendar using the SimpleCalendar controller. With this calendar, you have full control over various elements such as color, title, start-date, end-date, and more. You can implement the SimpleCalendarDelegate protocol to receive selected dates or provide dates as a data source.
